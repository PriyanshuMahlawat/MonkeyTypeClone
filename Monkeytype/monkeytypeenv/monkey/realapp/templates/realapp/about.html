    <p style="margin-left: 70px; margin-right: 70px; font-size: 20px;">Monkeytype is a minimalistic and customizable typing test. It features many test modes, an account system to save your typing speed history, and user-configurable features such as themes, sounds, a smooth caret, and more. Monkeytype attempts to emulate the experience of natural keyboard typing during a typing test, by unobtrusively presenting the text prompts and displaying typed characters in-place, providing straightforward, real-time feedback on typos, speed, and accuracy.

        <br>Test yourself in various modes, track your progress and improve your speed. </p>

        word set:<br>
        
        By default, this website uses the most common 3000 words in the English language to generate its tests. You can change the language as well.<br><br>
        keybinds:<br>
        
        You can use tab and enter (or just tab if you have quick tab mode enabled) to restart the typing test. Open the command line by pressing ctrl/cmd + shift + p or esc - there you can access all the functionality you need without touching your mouse
        <br><br>stats:<br>
        
        wpm - total number of characters in the correctly typed words (including spaces), divided by 5 and normalised to 60 seconds.
        
        raw wpm - calculated just like wpm, but also includes incorrect words.
        
        acc - percentage of correctly pressed keys.
        
        char - correct characters / incorrect characters. Calculated after the test has ended.
        
        consistency - based on the variance of your raw wpm. Closer to 100% is better. Calculated using the coefficient of variation of raw wpm and mapped onto a scale from 0 to 100.<br><br>
        results screen: <br> 
        
        After completing a test you will be able to see your wpm, raw wpm, accuracy, character stats, test length, leaderboards info and test info. (you can hover over some values to get floating point numbers). You can also see a graph of your wpm and raw over the duration of the test. Remember that the wpm line is a global average, while the raw wpm line is a local, momentary value. (meaning if you stop, the value is 0)
